### Pagination for User Repositories

GitHub Profile Finder includes a dynamic pagination system for displaying user repositories. This feature allows users to navigate through multiple pages of repositories conveniently.

### How Pagination Works

   - Users can click on a specific page number to navigate to that page.

2. **Prev and Next Buttons:**
   - The system includes "Prev" and "Next" buttons for easy navigation between pages.
   - Clicking the "Prev" button takes users to the previous page, and clicking the "Next" button takes them to the next page.

3. **Active Page Highlight:**
   - The active page is visually highlighted, making it easy for users to know which page they are currently viewing.

   - Click on a page number to navigate to that specific page of repositories.

2. **Prev and Next Buttons:**
   - Use the "Prev" and "Next" buttons to move to the previous or next page, respectively.

3. **Efficient Repository Browsing:**
   - Pagination ensures that repositories are presented in manageable chunks, enhancing the browsing experience for users with a large number of repositories.
